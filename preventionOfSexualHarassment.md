### 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
##### _Even though, employers have an obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent bullying and harassment, or minimize it, where possible, But as a co-worker or employee, we can do our part by:_
- We must report it when see it or experience it
- We only have to prove that the behavior was offensive to someone even if it was not the intended recipient, just find the appropriate 3rd party (supervisors, hr, officer, another colleague) to intervene the matter
- A subtle way to break it is to simply interrupting it
- I'll try to document whole thing in any way possible
- I'll directly confront the harasser and call out the behavior in the moment

**With that said, we can also follow some generic steps, to actually stop harassment and bullying in the first place by:** *Promote equity and respect in our workplace, and be an ally to someone being harassed*
