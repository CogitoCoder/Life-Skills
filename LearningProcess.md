## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique

### 1.1 Feynman Technique
The Feynman Technique is a learning method named after Richard Feynman. In this technique, a person explains the concept they are learning to themselves in a simple way to find gaps in their knowledge.

### 1.2 Ways To Implement Feynman Technique
### 1st Step
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Choose a subject*
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Write down everything you know about the subject. Divide into several parts.*

The first step of the Feynman Technique is to write your chosen topic at the top of a page. Then write down everything you know about it, and add it whenever you learn something new. The best way to take this first step is to write in simple terms. Think that you are explaining the subject to a child, that is, use basic vocabulary and make connections that are simple to understand.

Jargon and complicated terms can mask your level of learning – even to yourself. By writing the idea in clear language, you "force" yourself to understand enough to be able to simplify the relationships. It's okay if this seems difficult. Try to identify the points where you fail to understand, this enriches learning.

### 2nd Step
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Teach the concepts to someone else.*
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Teach – or pretend to teach – a child*

Here the idea is really to teach – it doesn't matter if you have an audience or not. The important thing is to explain the topic in terms that are easy to understand. Thus, you consolidate what you have understood so far and easily visualize what is still unclear.

### 3rd Step
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Identify the “holes” in your own understanding*
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*As you teach, questions will arise and you will encounter gaps in knowledge. Write down these gaps and study them.*

From your attempt to explain to another person, you will realize the holes in your own learning. Revisit these points and go back to your sources of information until you can fully explain the concept.

### 4th Step
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Review, organize and simplify*
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Simplify your knowledge so that anyone can understand what you are saying.*

Revise your work so far while further simplifying the language (make sure you are using your own words and not jargon from the material you have studied). Illustrate with examples and, if necessary, connect concepts and make analogies to strengthen your understanding. The goal is to organize all the content into a simple, flowing story.

Finally, read it aloud, and if it still seems confusing, it could be an indication that your understanding is not yet complete. If so, study again and fill in the "holes" again.
