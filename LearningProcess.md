## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique

### 1.1 Feynman Technique
The Feynman Technique is a learning method named after Richard Feynman. In this technique, a person explains the concept they are learning to themselves in a simple way to find gaps in their knowledge.

### 1.2 Ways To Implement Feynman Technique
### 1st Step
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Choose a subject*
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Write down everything you know about the subject. Divide into several parts.*

The first step of the Feynman Technique is to write your chosen topic at the top of a page. Then write down everything you know about it, and add it whenever you learn something new. The best way to take this first step is to write in simple terms. Think that you are explaining the subject to a child, that is, use basic vocabulary and make connections that are simple to understand.

Jargon and complicated terms can mask your level of learning – even to yourself. By writing the idea in clear language, you "force" yourself to understand enough to be able to simplify the relationships. It's okay if this seems difficult. Try to identify the points where you fail to understand, this enriches learning.

### 2nd Step
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Teach the concepts to someone else.*
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Teach – or pretend to teach – a child*

Here the idea is really to teach – it doesn't matter if you have an audience or not. The important thing is to explain the topic in terms that are easy to understand. Thus, you consolidate what you have understood so far and easily visualize what is still unclear.

### 3rd Step
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Identify the “holes” in your own understanding*
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*As you teach, questions will arise and you will encounter gaps in knowledge. Write down these gaps and study them.*

From your attempt to explain to another person, you will realize the holes in your own learning. Revisit these points and go back to your sources of information until you can fully explain the concept.

### 4th Step
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Review, organize and simplify*
- <span style="color:#FFFF99">*Simplify your knowledge so that anyone can understand what you are saying.*

Revise your work so far while further simplifying the language (make sure you are using your own words and not jargon from the material you have studied). Illustrate with examples and, if necessary, connect concepts and make analogies to strengthen your understanding. The goal is to organize all the content into a simple, flowing story.

Finally, read it aloud, and if it still seems confusing, it could be an indication that your understanding is not yet complete. If so, study again and fill in the "holes" again.

### 2.1 Video CRUX - "The Keys to Learning Effectively"
Here are the list of topics that Barbara Oakley talked about in her video.
- The elephant in the room:
  - How did you change your brain? : She dig deep to find the answer to her student's question.
- Brain's Operation
  - Focus Mode : Turn your attention and it gets on.
  - Diffuse Mode : It's a relaxed set of neural states.
  > <div align="center"> <img src="media/Focus&Diffuse.png"> <p><strong>Figure:</strong> Two Modes of Learning : The Pinball Analogy. </p> </div> 
- Analogy time: To better understand 2 modes of learning.
  - Pinball Machine :
    - When you're learning, you oscillate between these 2 modes, and if you find yourself focusing on something, and get stuck, turn your attention away from problem and allow the diffuse to do their work in background.
- Examples of 2 great personalities
  - Salvador Dali
  - Thomas Edison
- Procrastination

    - How to tackle it?
      - POMODORO 
- Slow thinking / Poor Memory
  - Some times best traits are the one, which you think are worst. 
- Illusions of competence in learning 
- Ways we can improve learning
  - Exercise
  - Test (Homework)
  - Recall
  
A brief description about them and steps to be taken to improve learning process are discussed below.

### 2.2 Steps to take to improve learning process.
- Use Metaphors, they provide powerful techniques for learning
- Focused and diffuse modes (when stuck, relax, let your mind flow in diffuse mode, then think in focused). Learning something difficult takes time give yourself some time to go back and forth in these states
- Using Pomodoro technique to avoid procrastination helps a lot, very useful for focusing (been using it)
- Practice makes permanent- neurons become linked together through repeated use. Test yourself and indulge deep into your Homework / drill.
  - You can't learn a song by listening it once, same goes with your homework, you can't excell it until you dig deep into it again and again.
- Spaced repetition- repeat what you’re trying to retain over a number of days, the chance to remember will be higher
- Exercise & Sleep properly:
    - increase our ability to both learn & remember
    - cleans toxic products in your brain
    - erases the less important parts of memories
    - strengthens areas that you need or want to remember
- Learning by doing, by active engagement and not passive listening. Active Recall helps a lot
- Understand the basic idea (understanding is like a glue to build and connect chunks)
- Recall is the best learning technique (instead of passive readings)
- Minimize highlights- try to understand the main idea first and then highlight
- Notes and helpful words are great- add them
- Tests yourself = recall
- Daily “to do” list /  daily journal works wonder
- Make them as small as a pomodoro chunk
- Feynman Technique

## 3. Learn Anything in 20 hours

### 3.1 Key Takeaways.
We may have heard of the 10,000 hours rule.

Originally, this came from a research by Prof. K. Anders Eriksson on expert-level performance of professional athletes, chess grandmasters, etc.

How long does it take to get to the top of the field? He found that it took 10,000 hours of practice

Studies on skills acquisition typically times how long a particular participant takes to accomplish a task. With a little bit of practice the time that it takes greatly reduces.

When you start, you are grossly incompetent. With a little bit of practice you become quite good really quick. At a certain point, you reach a plateau and the subsequent gains takes longer to reach.

For example, it may take you 5 hours to complete a task for the first time. But with a little practice you may find yourself completing the task in a shorter period of time such as 3 hours the second time around, 2 hours the third time, etc.

How long does it take to go from zero to become reasonably good at something?
Hint: It’s not 10,000 hours!

Research from Josh Kaufman indicates that it takes only 20 hours of focused, deliberate practice for you to become reasonably good at something.

### 3.2 Steps to take while approaching a new topic
#### Steps to Skill Acquisition
1. Deconstruct the skill
Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you’re done. The skill is kind of like a big bundles of skills. The more you can break apart the skills, the more you will be able to figure out which skills will help you to reach your goal.

1. Learn enough to self-correct
Get 3–5 resource about what you want to learn (books, CDs). Don’t use this as a form of procrastination.
Learn just enough so that you can self edit or self correct as you practice.
The learning becomes a way of getting better at noticing when you make a mistake and then doing something a little different.

1. Remove practice barriers
Identify the distractions that are keeping you from practicing (e.g. TV, internet, etc.) and eliminate them.

1. Practice for at least 20 hours
Most skills have the “frustration barrier” (i.e. that grossly incompetent feeling).
